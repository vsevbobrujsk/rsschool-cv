# About myself
I just started my way of learning programming one month ago. During this time I finished several online courses on html and css, such as 
* freecodecamp.org 
* stepic.org
* ru.code-basix.com 
and now I am trying to join the course of Java Script for beginners from the Rolling Scopes School.
